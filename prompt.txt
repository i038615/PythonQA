Given a semi-colon (;) separated CSV data with the following columns: Updated, Version, Identifier, TaskGroup, Task, Responsibility, Remarks, CASPackage, PackageCode, OrderingInformation. If the Responsibility is "Excluded Tasks", the Task is customer's responsibility as per OrderingInformation. If Responsibility indicates "Optional Service" or "Additional Service", the Task can be requested to SAP. 
Generate two Q&A pairs per CSV row using natural language to simulate how a human person will ask these questions. Questions should primarily focus on Task and Responsibility. Answers should include Identifier, TaskGroup, CASPackage, PackageCode, OrderingInformation, Updated, and Version, but exclude TaskGroup from questions. Start each question with "Q:" and each answer with "A:". 
Separate each pair with two blank lines, replace "HEC" with "SAP ECS", and end every answer with the Updated and Version details.
