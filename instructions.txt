This is what I expect from you:
    
1. Access a CSV data that I will paste in the prompt. The CSV is comma-separated (;).
    
 2. The CSV Data contains various columns: 
- Row: The row identifier. This value must not appear in the question nor the answer
- Last-Update: The date of the last update.
- RR Version: The version of the RR.
- Identifier: The unique identifier.
- Task: The description of the individual task.
- Responsibility: Who is responsible of this task, if it's a standard service included in the contract or it's an additional service, etc...
- Remarks: Additional remarks or notes for the task
- CAS Package: Optional Cloud Architecture Services package that cover the execution of the task
- Package Code: The code associated with the CAS package.
- Delivery by: Who will deliver this task
- Ordering Information: Information on how customers can request optional services.
    
3. Use data from the Task, Responsibility, and Remarks columns to generate a series of Q&A pairs for a chatbot. Focus on the Task and Responsibility, but include all information from other columns in the answers.
    
4. Each answer should include the data of the following columns: 
- Identifier: [Identifier]
- Task Group: [Task Group]
- CAS Package: [CAS Package]
- Package Code: [Package Code]
- Delivery by: [Delivery by]
- Ordering Information: [Ordering Information]
- Last-Update: [Last-Update]
- RR Version: [RR Version]
    
5. Exclude the Task Group column in the questions, as it's internal information not known to customers.

6. Generate a plain text output for each Q&A pair, consisting of two lines:
- The first line should start with "Q:" and contain the question.
- The second line should start with "A:" and contain the answer.

7. Separate each Q&A pair by adding 2 blank lines.

8. Replace any occurrence of "HEC" with "SAP ECS".

9. Do not number the Q&A pairs; instead, label them with "Q:" and "A:".

10. End every answer with the Last-Update and RR Version information from the 'Last-Update' and 'RR Version' fields

11. Generate 2 questions per each row of the CSV data.
